### About the project
__The Cursed Temple Door__ started as a game jam submission. <br>
ErinDJV and I were both participants in the [Jamsepticeye game jam](https://itch.io/jam/jamsepticeye), and ErinDJV's submission was a command line game written in python, aka the original version of this game. <br>
I first played it during the rating half of the jam, then asked ErinDJV if we could collab to turn it into a browser game, and after the jam ended, we made this version. <br>
